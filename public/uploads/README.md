# Upload Directory

This directory is used for storing uploaded files for the Policy Management platform.

## Purpose
- Stores policy documents uploaded through the web interface
- Ensures proper permissions for file uploads
- Maintains a consistent file structure for the application

## Security Considerations
- Files are renamed with unique identifiers to prevent filename conflicts
- Only authenticated users can upload files through the API
- Automatic directory creation if it doesn't exist
- Permission checks ensure proper write access

## Usage
Uploaded files can be accessed at `/uploads/filename` in the browser.

## Troubleshooting
If upload errors occur, check:
1. Directory permissions (should be readable and writable by the application)
2. Available disk space
3. File size limits in the application configuration

Files are automatically processed and validated to ensure they meet requirements before being stored in this directory.
