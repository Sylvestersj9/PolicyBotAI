502 Bad Gateway error. This usually means that your backend server is either crashing, not responding, or misconfigured. Let's go through some potential fixes:

🔍 Troubleshooting Steps
1️⃣ Check Replit Logs
Go to Replit Console and check the logs for error messages.

Look for errors related to server crashes, missing files, or incorrect configurations.

2️⃣ Restart the App
Click the "Stop" button in Replit.

Click "Run" again to restart your server.

3️⃣ Ensure Your Server is Running
If your app uses Express.js, FastAPI, or another framework, make sure your server is actually running.

Run your backend manually in the Replit console:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm start
or

sh
Copy
Edit
tsx server/index.ts
If there are errors, they will show up in the logs.

4️⃣ Check for Missing Files
Your previous errors mentioned missing files like:

perl
Copy
Edit
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
Make sure all required files and folders exist in your Replit project.

5️⃣ Check for Syntax Errors in Your Code
If your code has mistakes, the server might fail to start.

Check recent changes and undo any breaking changes.

6️⃣ Test Your API Locally
If possible, download your project, run it on your local machine, and see if it works.

7️⃣ Check Your Ports
Replit sometimes blocks certain ports. Make sure your server is running on port 3000 or 8080.

Example Express.js setup:

ts
Copy
Edit
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
8️⃣ Check for Timeout Issues
If your server takes too long to respond (e.g., long AI processing), Replit may kill the request.

Try adding a basic API response to confirm if the server is alive:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Server is running!");
});
9️⃣ Rebuild Dependencies
Your app may be missing dependencies. Try running:

sh
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
🔟 Check Replit Status
If nothing works, Replit might be down. Check their status:

✅ Next Steps
Try restarting your Replit project.

Check logs for specific errors.

Fix any missing files or incorrect configurations.

Ensure the backend is actually running.

If Replit is unstable, consider moving to another platform like GitHub Codespaces or Vercel.
