 integrate AI to properly summarize and answer questions from the uploaded policy and procedure documents in your web app, you can follow these steps:

1. Set Up File Uploading and Extraction
Since you've already implemented file uploads (e.g., PDFs, DOCs), ensure your web app is correctly handling and extracting text from these files.

For PDFs: Use a package like pdf-parse to extract text from uploaded PDFs.

For DOCX files: Use mammoth or docx to extract text from Word documents.

Ensure the text extraction works as expected and is stored in your database after a user uploads a document.

2. Integrate AI to Process Extracted Text
Once you have the text extracted from the documents, you can integrate a simple AI model that will summarize the text and answer questions based on that text.

Steps for AI Integration:
Summarization: You can use an AI-based NLP service, like OpenAI's GPT, or use Hugging Face models to generate summaries.

You can fine-tune the model to summarize long policy documents effectively.

Question Answering: Once the document is processed, you can use the model to answer questions like: “What is the purpose of this policy?” or “What are the main points of this procedure?”

3. Building the AI Functionality
You can create a function in your backend (Node.js, for example) to send the extracted text to an AI API (like OpenAI or Hugging Face).

Here’s an overview of how to send text to AI for processing:

typescript
Copy
Edit
import axios from 'axios';

async function sendToAI(text: string) {
  const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
    model: 'text-davinci-003', // or any other suitable model
    prompt: `Summarize the following policy:\n\n${text}`,
    max_tokens: 200,  // Adjust as per the required length
    temperature: 0.7,
  }, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  return response.data.choices[0].text.trim();
}
4. Integrate AI Summarization in Your Upload Flow
After extracting text from uploaded files, pass that text into the sendToAI function.

Store the AI’s response (summary) along with the file in your database.

When users ask questions about their policies, you can use the stored summary or processed content to answer those queries.

5. Frontend UI Integration
Allow users to view the summarized content in the UI after the AI processes their uploaded documents.

Implement a simple search box where users can input questions, and the AI can provide relevant answers based on the summarized content.

Summary Flow:
User uploads a document (PDF or DOCX).

Text is extracted from the document and stored.

The extracted text is sent to the AI model for summarization.

The summary is stored alongside the document.

Users can ask questions related to the policy, and the AI answers based on the summary or full document.

6. Testing and Deployment
Test the AI's performance on a variety of policies to ensure the answers are accurate. Adjust the prompt or AI model parameters if needed.
