Step 1: Check Replit Logs
Open your Replit project.

Click on the Console or Shell tab.

Run the following command to restart and check logs:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm start
or

sh
Copy
Edit
tsx server/index.ts
Look for any errors in the logs. Copy and paste them here so I can help analyze them.

Step 2: Verify Your Server is Running
A 502 error means Replit is trying to reach your server, but it isn't responding properly.
Run this command to check if your server is actually running:

sh
Copy
Edit
ps aux | grep node
If your server is not listed, it isn't running.

If it's running but still failing, we need to check port settings.

Step 3: Ensure Correct Port Configuration
Replit usually assigns a dynamic PORT instead of a fixed one like 3000.

Open your server/index.ts (or wherever your Express.js server is defined).

Ensure you're using:

ts
Copy
Edit
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
If you hardcoded a port like 8080, Replit might block it. Try changing to process.env.PORT.

Step 4: Test If the Server is Reachable
Add a simple test endpoint in your server/index.ts file:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Server is working!");
});
Now, visit:
üëâ https://policybotai.replit.app/test
If this route works, your server is running, but other routes may be broken.

Step 5: Check for Missing Files (ENOENT Error)
You previously got this error:

perl
Copy
Edit
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf'
Run this command in Replit Shell:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls -l ./test/data/
If the file is missing, Replit is looking for a file that doesn't exist.

Either upload the missing file or update your code to handle missing files safely:

ts
Copy
Edit
const fs = require('fs');
const filePath = './test/data/05-versions-space.pdf';

if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) {
    console.log("File does not exist, skipping...");
} else {
    const fileData = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
}
Step 6: Check for Broken Imports
Your previous error:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/home/runner/workspace/server/aiService'
Go to server/index.ts

Find where you're importing aiService:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { sendToAI } from './server/aiService';
Ensure aiService.ts exists:

sh
Copy
Edit
ls -l server/
If it's missing, re-create it or fix the import path.

Step 7: Check for Dependency Issues
Run this in Replit Shell:

sh
Copy
Edit
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
This will reinstall dependencies and fix broken packages.

Step 8: Restart and Test Again
Click "Stop" in Replit

Click "Run"

Visit: https://policybotai.replit.app/test

Final Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Check the logs after restarting.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If the test route works but the AI is broken, the AI function might be misconfigured.
3Ô∏è‚É£ If errors persist, copy the logs here, and I'll help analyze them.
