Build an AI Function for Summarizing and Answering Questions from Policy Documents

1. Requirements:
I need a function that processes user-uploaded PDF, DOCX, or TXT files, extracts the text from these documents, and then uses AI (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT or Hugging Face) to summarize the document.

The AI should also be able to answer specific questions related to the content of the documents (e.g., "What is the purpose of this policy?").

The summary and extracted text should be stored in the database, and the AI should answer questions based on this stored data.

2. Steps for File Processing:
A. File Upload Handling:
Users will upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files.

I already have the file upload setup using Multer (for Express).

The files should be stored in the uploads/ directory.

B. Text Extraction from Files:
For PDFs, use the pdf-parse package to extract the text.

For DOCX files, use the mammoth package to extract the text.

For TXT files, simply read the file contents directly.

Example Code for File Extraction:
typescript
Copy
Edit
import pdfParse from 'pdf-parse';
import mammoth from 'mammoth';
import fs from 'fs';

// Function to handle file extraction
async function extractTextFromFile(filePath: string, fileType: string) {
  const fileBuffer = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
  
  if (fileType === 'pdf') {
    const data = await pdfParse(fileBuffer);
    return data.text; // Returns the extracted text from PDF
  } else if (fileType === 'docx') {
    const { value } = await mammoth.extractRawText({ buffer: fileBuffer });
    return value; // Returns the extracted text from DOCX
  } else if (fileType === 'txt') {
    return fileBuffer.toString(); // Returns the text directly from TXT file
  } else {
    throw new Error('Unsupported file type');
  }
}
3. AI Interaction:
A. Summarization via OpenAI API:
The extracted text will be sent to OpenAI's API (GPT-3, text-davinci-003 model) to summarize the document.

The AI will also answer specific questions based on the document text (e.g., "What is the purpose of this policy?").

You will need to pass the extracted document text into the AI’s API and format the request properly.

Example Code for AI Summarization:
typescript
Copy
Edit
import axios from 'axios';

async function summarizeTextWithAI(text: string) {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
  const prompt = `Summarize the following policy document:\n\n${text}`;
  
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
    model: 'text-davinci-003',  // Or another suitable model like GPT-4
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 500,  // Adjust as per the required summary length
    temperature: 0.7,
  }, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  return response.data.choices[0].text.trim(); // Return the summarized text
}
B. Answering Specific Questions:
Use the OpenAI API to answer specific questions based on the extracted document text.

Example query: "What is the purpose of this policy?".

AI will return an answer based on the content of the document.

Example Code for Question Answering:
typescript
Copy
Edit
async function answerQuestionFromAI(text: string, question: string) {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY';
  const prompt = `Based on the following policy document, answer the question:\n\n${text}\n\nQuestion: ${question}\nAnswer:`;

  const response = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/completions', {
    model: 'text-davinci-003',
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 200,
    temperature: 0.7,
  }, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  });

  return response.data.choices[0].text.trim(); // Return the answer to the question
}
4. Database Integration:
After summarizing the document and processing the question-answer pairs, save the AI responses (summaries and answers) to your database.

Create a schema for storing the uploaded file, extracted text, AI summary, and related answers.

You can store this data in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) or SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

Example Code for Saving to Database (MongoDB):
typescript
Copy
Edit
import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';

const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
await client.connect();
const db = client.db('policyApp');
const policiesCollection = db.collection('policies');

async function savePolicyToDatabase(filePath: string, summary: string, text: string) {
  const policyDocument = {
    filePath,
    summary,
    text,
    uploadedAt: new Date(),
  };

  const result = await policiesCollection.insertOne(policyDocument);
  console.log('Policy document saved:', result);
}
5. Frontend Integration:
On the frontend, after users upload their files, allow them to view the AI-generated summary.

Also, create a UI to ask specific questions related to their uploaded policies.

Display the AI-generated answers directly on the UI.

Expected Flow in Your Web App:
User Uploads Document: User uploads a policy document (PDF/DOCX/TXT).

Text Extraction: The system extracts text from the uploaded file.

Summarization: The extracted text is sent to the AI model for summarization.

Database Save: The document, summary, and any relevant information are stored in the database.

User Query: The user can then ask a specific question about the policy.

Answer Generation: The AI answers the user's question based on the document text.

Display Results: The answer is displayed to the user on the frontend.

Things to Ensure:
Error Handling: Make sure the AI API interactions handle errors gracefully (e.g., network errors, API rate limits).

Security: Ensure that API keys and sensitive data are not exposed.

Performance: Optimize for large documents and ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent users and document uploads efficiently.
